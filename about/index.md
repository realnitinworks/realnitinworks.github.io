> ## What defines me
> I believe that "Quality is not a mistake". It is an incremental process with well-defined steps, 
doing each step in an orderly pattern. Each step is properly tested before moving into the next. 
This will make sure that the final product is of top-notch quality. 
I strive to achieve this in everything I do in my life. This defines me.
